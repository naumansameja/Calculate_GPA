Create a class that would calculate the GPA for any semester.
The class would have subjects as data member. Subjects would be a dictionary of subjects along with its credit hours.
A user would provide grades for each subject and class should return the GPA. 
PS: We would initialize the object of the class by providing dictionary of the subjects to init method and use that object to calculate the GPA

User will enter grades i.e A+, B+ as input for each subject
